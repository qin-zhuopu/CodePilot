/**
 * Codex app-server reasoning-effort compatibility.
 *
 * ── Phase 0 (2026-07-17): per-model allowlist, not a global clamp ──────
 *
 * The rule is now "send exactly what THIS model declares in `model/list`":
 *
 *   - GPT-5.6 Sol declares low/medium/high/xhigh/max/ultra. Its `xhigh` /
 *     `max` are REAL and are forwarded verbatim — the old global clamp
 *     silently downgraded them to `high`, so the user paid for a tier the
 *     wire never carried (exactly the "UI 数字不是用户以为的意思" failure).
 *   - A level the current model does not declare is OMITTED, never coerced
 *     into a neighbouring tier. Omission lets Codex apply its own default;
 *     coercion invents a semantic the user didn't choose.
 *
 * `clampCodexEffort` survives ONLY as the no-capability-info fallback (cold
 * model/list cache, logged out, old binary). That path still can't know
 * whether the binary is one of the strict old builds that REJECT unknown
 * variants FATALLY — observed 2026-05-31 with `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex`:
 *   `Failed to deserialize overridden config: unknown variant `xhigh``
 * (even codex 0.133 only tolerates them with a warning, falling back to
 * `medium`). Absent evidence, staying conservative there is correct.
 *
 * Scope: codex_runtime ONLY. Claude Code / Native runtimes keep the full
 * union for Anthropic models — do NOT route their effort through here.
 *
 * Root-cause + POC: docs/research/packaged-preview-runtime-diagnosis-2026-05-31.md
 * Schema drift + 5.6 tiers: docs/research/foundation-experience-refresh-2026-07-17.md
